      <h2>MECH Welcome</h2>
      <p>
        Greetings and a warm welcome to Make Every Child Happy (MECH) — a youth-led, purpose-driven nonprofit committed to transforming the lives of learners across South Africa.
      </p>
      <p>
        Founded on the belief that every child deserves dignity, support, and opportunity, MECH stands as a beacon of hope for learners from underprivileged communities. Our work is rooted in compassion, community, and a clear vision: to create an environment where children can learn, grow, and dream — without barriers.
      </p>
      <p>
        We work tirelessly to ensure that no child is left behind due to lack of basic necessities. Through our initiatives, including the provision of sanitary pads, toiletries, food parcels, and career guidance expos, we aim to address the real challenges faced by students in rural and township schools. Together with our volunteers, partners, and supporters, we are building a future where learners are empowered, supported, and truly happy.
      </p>

      <h2>Message from the Board of Directors</h2>
      <p>
        As the Board of Directors of Make Every Child Happy (MECH), we are deeply honored to guide this mission that touches the hearts of communities across South Africa. Our purpose is rooted in love, equality, and a determination to break the chains of poverty through education and dignity.
      </p>
      <p>
        We have seen firsthand how even the smallest acts of generosity — a sanitary pad, a warm meal, a word of encouragement — can transform the life of a young learner. That’s why MECH exists: to fill these crucial gaps and ensure no child is left feeling invisible or forgotten.
      </p>
      <p>
        As we grow and reach more schools and learners, we invite you — as a supporter, volunteer, or donor — to walk with us. Together, we are not just giving hope. We are building futures.
